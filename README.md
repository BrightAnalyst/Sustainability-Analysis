**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis was derived from smart city activity logs and includes the following fields:

* Age Groups (18–27, 28–37, 38–47, 48–57, 58+)
* Energy Consumption (kWh)
* Carbon Footprint (kg CO₂)
* Work Hours
* Calories Burned
* Shopping Frequency
* Transportation Type

The data was filtered, cleaned, and transformed for consistency, and segment-level summaries were created for effective visualization.

**Tools and Methodology**

Power BI: Dashboard design, KPI cards, and category trend visualization
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, segmentation, and wrangling
DAX: Employed for calculated columns and measures within the dashboard

**Dashboard Structure**

The Excel dashboard is structured for dynamic exploration of smart city behavior:

**Lifestyle Overview**

* Summary of Energy Use, Work Hours, Carbon Footprint, and Calories Burned
* Comparative view across age groups

**Environmental Impact**

* Carbon Emission by Transport Type
* Age Group–wise emission sources
* Key sustainability indicators

* Shopping behavior by age
* Transport trends (car, walking, cycling)
* Segment-level insights

**Key Insights**

* **Energy Consumption** is highest among older residents, indicating a need for efficient appliances and energy awareness programs.
* **Carbon Footprint** from vehicles peaks among middle-aged groups; walking and cycling show promise in lowering emissions.
